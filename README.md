# EDA
You work for a consumer finance company that specializes in providing various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, it has to decide whether to approve or reject it based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business for the company.
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e., they are likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to financial loss for the company.
The data given below contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’. The aim is to identify patterns indicating that a person is likely to default, which may be used to deny the loan, reduce the loan amount, lend to risky applicants at a higher interest rate, etc.
In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency to default.

BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and the financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower-interest-rate loans through a fast online interface.
Like most other lending companies, lending to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or absconds with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the biggest losses to lenders. In this case, customers labeled as ‘charged-off’ are the ‘defaulters’.
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced, thereby cutting down on the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e., the variables that are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
To develop your understanding of the domain, you are advised to independently research a little about risk analytics (understanding the types of variables and their significance should be enough).
